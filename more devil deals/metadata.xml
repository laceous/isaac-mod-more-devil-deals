    <description>This mod enables Devil Deals (+Angel Deals) to show up in more stages:
[list]
    [*]Basement I (early deal)
    [*]Mausoleum II (Dad's Note)
    [*]Corpse II (Mother)
    [*]??? (Hush)
    [*]Sheol / Cathedral (Satan / Isaac)
    [*]Dark Room / Chest (The Lamb / ???)
    [*]The Void (Delirium)
[/list]

Normal RNG should apply. It won't show the percentages in the UI though.

Fighting Hush doesn't yield much of a reward outside of a guaranteed path to The Void. This mod gives you more incentive to go that way by giving you a guaranteed Devil or Angel deal once you defeat Hush. Simply walk into The Void room and you'll be presented with both options. No Duality or Goat Head required.

Mod Config Menu can be used to enable or disable specific stages.</description>
